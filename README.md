This is a simple program I coded to calculate which team would win Football World Cup 2022.

In this reposotiry you can find the code I used to calculate the winner of Football World Cup 2022 (in C++), a summary of the project in PDF format, and this README.

This code and its results weren't used for monetary reasons (no bets were made). The ONLY motivation to work on this project was, and persits to be, the aim of learning about the math and programing behind this predictions.

Furthermore, this program is far from being perfect or precise. Therefore, I must warn that the results this program provides are NOT accurate and that I will not take responsibility for any use of the code. In fact, due to the inexistence of a LICENSE file in this repository, it is protected under the default copyright laws (see GitHub Licensing Policy). Therefore, all missues of the program will be punished in the measure we can, regardless it access is open.

The results I predicted in 2022 were:

Team      simulation    real
Brasil    1             quarterfinals
Uruguay   2             groups phase
Argentina 3             1 (winner)
England   4             quarterfinals
