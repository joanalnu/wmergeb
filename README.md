This is a easy program I coded to calculate which team would win Football World Cup 2022.


In this repository you can find the code I used to calculate the winner of Football World Cup 2022 (in C++). This code and its results weren't used for monetary reasons (any were bets made).

The ONLY motivation to work on this project was, and will be, the aim of learning about the math and coding behind this predictions.

This program is far from being perfect or precise. Therefore, I must warn that the results this program provides are NOT precise and that I will not have responsibility for any use of the code, in fact, all missuses of the program will be punished in the measure we can, regardless it access is open.

The results I predicted were
Team      simulation    real
Brasil    1             quarterfinals
Uruguay   2             groups phase
Argentina 3             1 (winner)
England   4             quarterfinals
